"""LDRAGO v2 — Cognitive Agent System.

Multi-agent reasoning architecture with specialized cognitive roles:
  - Parser     : Interprets user intent, extracts entities
  - Location   : Resolves geographic mentions to coordinates
  - Planner    : Decomposes questions into simulation tasks
  - Researcher : Gathers data and context
  - Reasoner   : Deep analysis and causal inference
  - Critic     : Validates, challenges, finds inconsistencies
  - Synthesizer: Merges all outputs into coherent insight
  - Viz Output : Converts results to globe-ready GeoJSON

Each agent is a stateless async function that takes context and
returns structured output. The Orchestrator coordinates them.
